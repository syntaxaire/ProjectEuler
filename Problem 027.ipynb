    "Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:\n",
    "$$n^{2}+n+41$$\n",
    "It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0≤n≤39$. However, when $n=40, 40^{2}+40+41=40(40+1)+41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n=41,41^{2}+41+41$ is clearly divisible by 41.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incredible formula $n^{2}−79n+1601n$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0≤n≤790≤n≤79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.\n",

    "$n^{2}+an+b$, where $|a|<1000$ and $|b|≤1000$\n",
